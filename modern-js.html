# "Modern" JS

- ES6 or ECMAScript2015 is the latest version of the JS language standard. It
adds a number of new features that are well described in
[many](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features),
[many](http://es6-features.org/) [places](http://es6fiddle.net/)
- so I'll just highlight a few that I've used in the context of writing JS code on the Agent
dash.
- (I'll use some Python terminology to draw parallels).
- You can try these out at [es6fiddle](http://www.es6fiddle.net)

# Classes

```js
class Foo {
  static foo() {
    return "this is an inherited classmethod";
  }
}

class McFoo extends Foo {
  // This is a special method, like __init__
  // Also notice the default value
  constructor(quux=2) {
    // construct Foo
    super();
    this.baz = quux;
  }

  show() {
    console.log(this.baz);
  }
}
```

---

```js
let f = new McFoo(3);
f.show(); // 3

(new McFoo()).show(); // 2

console.log(McFoo.foo()); // "this is an...
```
---

ES7 property initializers are a proposal that add more familiar syntax

```js
class Foo {
  static baz = 2;
  bar = 3;
}
```
This [babel
transform](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-class-properties/) allows
us to use it today

---

# Lambdas ("arrow" functions)

```js
var x = (y) => 2*y;
console.log(x(2)); // 4
```

---

# String formatting (interpolation, or templating)

```js
var name = "Bob", time = "today";
`Hello ${name}, how are you ${time}?`
```

---


# Unpacking ("destructuring") assignments

```js
var [a, ,b] = [1,2,3]
var {a, b} = {"a": 1, "b": 3, "c": 2}
```

---

# "Rest" operator: ...

```js
function more(a, b, ...theRest) {
  // args is array of the arguments except a, b
  console.log(theRest.length);
}

more(1,2,3,4); // 2
```

---

# "spread" operator

which is the inverse of the "rest" operator, but looks identical

```js
var parts = ['shoulders', 'knees'];
var lyrics = ['head', ...parts, 'and', 'toes']; // ["head", "shoulders",
"knees", "and", "toes"]

```

- While ES6 only specifies Rest and Spread for iterables (ie arrays), there is
a [proposal to add them to
objects](https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ecmascript-rest-spread) and a
corresponding Babel.

- We have this, which allows us to write
`<Component {...this.props} />` to pass `props` to child components.

- (But this
is an antipattern - see [unknown
props](https://github.com/finventures/fin-core-beta/wiki/Javascript-Warnings))

# `let` and `const`

`let` is usually better than `var`; `var`'s scope is the enclosing function,
whereas `let` behaves more sanely and scopes itself to the enclosing block.

```js
let v = 2;
```

`const` indicates that the variable cannot be rebound to a different value.

```js
const x = 1;
x = 2; // ERROR
```

A couple of surprising things you might encounter-
  * `let` doesn't create properties on the enclosing "global" object, so you
  should still use `var` for this
  * Multiple `let`s for the same variable in a block will throw an error;
  `switch` statements are one block, so you can't call `let foo=2` in each
  `case` section.
  * `const foo = {"a":2, "b": 3};` does not prevent the RHS obj from being
  mutated

---

# Iterators and Generators

```js
let y = [1,2,3];
for (var x of y) {

```

Can define [custom
iterables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols)
by creating a function named `Symbol.iterator` on your object, which returns an
iterator object implementing `next()`. `next()` returns `{done: false, value:
...}`.

```js
let fibonacci = {
  [Symbol.iterator]() {
    return {
      next() {
        ...
        return { done: false, value: cur }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

ES6 also has a `yield` which makes writing iterables easier, and enables more
powerful async programming.

---

#`import` and `export`

```js
// in a library
export default function() { return "foo" };
export bar;
export baz;
export * from "another/lib";

// in a user of the library
import foo, {bar, baz} from Library;
```

---

# :symbols

```js
var key = Symbol("key");
this[key] = 2; //different from this["key"]
```

---

# `Map`, `Set`, `WeakMap`, `WeakSet`

The weak versions allow objects as keys, and these are weak references.

---

# Proxies

Allow `methodMissing`-style interception

---

# Promises

- Encapsulates the pattern of starting async work, and calling `success` or
`error` callbacks after the work is done.
- Except that the callbacks can be
bound on the Promise, they can be chained (piped), parallelized, raced,
etc.
- [Read more](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/).
- Mixed with generators, these evolve into async/await functions in ES7.
